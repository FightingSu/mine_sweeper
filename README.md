# Qt Mine Sweeper

 A simple implementation of mine sweeper using Qt5. 



## Description

This application is a simple imitation of Microsoft's mine sweeper, majorly focus on functionality, not UI.

Most of the function was implemented in this application:

+ User defined mine field
+ Automatic open near blocks of a block if there is no mine near that block
+ High lighting one block if mouse hovers
+ Show how mine scattered around after game ends

Here is an GIF shows how this application looks like:
